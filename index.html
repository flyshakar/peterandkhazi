  <ul>
    <li>Born on March 25, 1914, in Cresco, Iowa</li>
    <li>In 1933, he left his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota, thanks to a Depression-era program known as the "National Youth Administration"</li>
    <li>Had to stop school and save up more money. Worked in the Civilian Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."</li>
    <li>In 1937, he finished university and took a job in the US Forestry Service</li>
    <li>In 1938, he married his wife of 69 years, Margret Gibson. Got laid off due to budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returned to school to study under Stakman, who taught him about breeding pest-resistant plants</li>
    <li>In 1941, he tried to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but was rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria, disinfectants, and other applied science</li>
    <li>In 1942, he received a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li>
    <li>In 1944, he rejected a 100% salary increase from Dupont, left behind his pregnant wife, and flew to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team bred 6,000 different strains of disease-resistant wheat - including different varieties for each major climate on Earth</li>
    <li>In 1945, he discovered a way to grow wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields</li>
    <li>In 1953, he crossed a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yielding American breed, creating a strain that responded well to fertilizer. It went on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat</li>
    <li>In 1962, he visited Delhi and brought his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding population</li>
    <li>In 1970, he received the Nobel Peace Prize</li>
    <li>In 1983, he helped seven African countries dramatically increase their maize and sorghum yields</li>
    <li>In 1984, he became a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University</li>
    <li>In 2005, he stated "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argued that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Said that GM crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."</li>
    <li>In 2009, he passed away at the age of 95</li>
